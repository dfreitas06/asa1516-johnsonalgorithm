# Johnson's Algorithm

### Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms - 2nd Project

This project consists in developing an algorithm, in a programming language of our choice, that solves the problem following problem:

*The company Coelho e Caracol Lda. is a merchandise transporter. This company had huge success last year due to the commitment of the Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms students from IST. Mr. Caracolstays in his office planning the routes while Mr. Coelho takes care of the coordination between the trucks and existing subsidiaries. To celebrate the success of the company Mr. Caracol decided to organize a company meeting which should join the company's employees from all the subsidiaries. The problem consists in finding an adequate meeting point. In this project we are going to develop a software to solve this problem automatically.*

The chosen language for our algorithm was C++ and as the title indicates the algorithm we deemed appropriate to solve this problem was the Johnson's Algorithm.
